  - Hello friend, welcome to the cat community...
  - composed entirely of cats and entirely at sea!
  - ...this place is still pretty new
  - so right now it's just a few cats with their boats
  - but that won't last too long
  - '...so for now enjoy the sights '
  - 'and catch some fish my friend. '
